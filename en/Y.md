Y media (https://wy.media) - Content Platform

## Y Media Platform Capabilities

### 1. Content Creation and Monetization
- **Content Creation**: Creators (videographers, bloggers, musicians) upload videos, podcasts, articles or other content to the **Y** platform.
- **Monetization**:
  - Creators receive YDM tokens for each uploaded content (e.g., per video).
  - They also earn tokens for views of their content by viewers.
- **For whom**: For everyone who creates content and wants to monetize it.

### 2. Video Advertising
- **Ad Placement**: Creators can allow advertising in their videos. For example, a 30-second commercial before a video or a banner in the description.
- **Ad Revenue**: Creators receive YDM tokens for each ad placement in their content. Advertisers pay the platform for placement, and part of the revenue is distributed to creators as cashback in tokens.
- **For whom**: For creators who are open to advertising, and for advertisers who want to promote their products.

### 3. Merch and Sponsored Content
- **Merch Sales**: Creators can sell merch (e.g., t-shirts, mugs with their channel logos) through the **Y** platform or integrate it with the **Z** platform (goods and services).
- **Sponsored Content**: Creators can create videos for sponsors (e.g., product reviews) and receive YDM tokens for such projects.
- **For whom**: For creators who want to earn from merch and sponsorship contracts.

### 4. Premium Subscription for Viewers
- **Ad-Free Premium**: Viewers can pay for a premium subscription to watch content without ads.
- **Premium Revenue Distribution**: Revenue from premium subscriptions is distributed among content creators based on their video watch time. For example, if a viewer spent more time on one creator's video, that creator gets more YDM tokens.
- **For whom**: For viewers who want an improved ad-free experience, and for creators who get additional revenue.

### 5. Token Cashback for Creators
- Creators receive cashback in YDM tokens from platform revenue from advertising and premium subscriptions. For example, if an advertiser paid for an ad in a video, part of that amount is returned to the creator in tokens. Same with premium subscriptions: revenue is distributed among creators based on views.

# X Digital Marketplace Project Documentation: Platform Z

## Project Overview
**X Digital Marketplace** is an ecosystem of four independent platforms, each representing a separate business and using its own token for value distribution. In this documentation we focus on platform **Z** - a universal marketplace for selling goods and services, integrated into the ecosystem. Other platforms - **Y** (media platform), **V** (logistics and transportation) and **W** (assets) - work on a similar principle, but with focus on their areas.

Platform **Z** uses ZDM tokens for value distribution among participants. The founder owns a significant share of tokens to maintain control, but most tokens are distributed among sellers, customers, developers and used for platform development. This makes participants co-owners of the ecosystem, where they earn tokens for their activity.

## Economic Processes on Platform Z

### 1. Token Earnings for Sellers
- **For goods sales**: Sellers receive ZDM tokens for each sale. For example, a clothing seller sells a t-shirt and receives tokens.
- **For service provision**: Freelancers and specialists earn ZDM tokens for completed orders (e.g., designer for creating a logo).
- **For customer attraction**: Sellers receive bonus ZDM tokens for attracting new customers (e.g., through referral links).

### 2. Cashback for Customers
- Customers who buy goods or services receive cashback in ZDM tokens. For example, a customer buys a phone and receives tokens as a bonus.

### 3. Integration with Logistics and Assets
- After purchasing goods, the customer can order delivery through platform **V**, choosing suitable transport (courier, truck, drone). Seller and customer receive additional ZDM tokens for using the ecosystem.
- Sellers can tokenize their goods or business on platform **W** and sell them as assets. For example, a seller tokenizes a batch of goods, and an investor on **W** buys it to resell.

### 4. Token Freezing for Motivation
- Part of tokens earned by sellers and customers is frozen for 1 week with a bonus. For example, if a customer received cashback for a purchase, half of the tokens are frozen, and after a week they receive them with an additional bonus, motivating token holding.

### 5. Co-ownership and Future Voting
- Sellers, customers and developers receive ZDM tokens, making them platform co-owners. They own a significant share of the ecosystem, giving them rights to future benefits.
- In 2-3 years, voting will be introduced where participants can decide how to develop the platform (e.g., what new product categories to add).
